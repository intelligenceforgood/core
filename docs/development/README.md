# Development Docs

Purpose: build- and implementation-focused guides that evolve with the codebase. Use these for local setup, contracts, and day-to-day workflows.

## Contents
- Developer guide: [dev_guide.md](dev_guide.md)
- Technical design (API/contracts): [tdd.md](tdd.md)
- Coverage and bundles: [bundle_sources_and_coverage.md](bundle_sources_and_coverage.md)
- Retrieval on GCP: [retrieval_gcp_guide.md](retrieval_gcp_guide.md)
- Glossary: [glossary.md](glossary.md)

## When to add here
- Implementation details, API/schema changes, build tooling, or environment setup for engineers.
- For operational response, use [runbooks](../runbooks/README.md); for enduring architecture/security, use [design](../design/README.md).
