# Design Docs

Purpose: long-lived architectural references—system topology, IAM/security, and data custody. Use these when making cross-cutting or platform decisions.

## Contents
- System architecture: [architecture.md](architecture.md)
- IAM strategy: [iam.md](iam.md)
- PII vault model: [pii_vault.md](pii_vault.md)

## When to add here
- Architectural decisions, security/identity models, data custody and trust boundaries, or diagrams that outlive a sprint.
- Prefer short pages that link back to the docs hub. For implementation details or how-tos, use [development](../development/README.md) or [cookbooks](../cookbooks/README.md).
